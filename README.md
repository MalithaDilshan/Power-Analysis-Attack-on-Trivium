# Power-Analysis-Attack-on-Trivium

The side channel attack is typically new type of attack which can be used to break different cipher implementations. Specially, this types of attacks vulnerable for different embedded systems, smart cards etc. The power analysis attack is a part of the side channel attack which is mostly used different researches. There are three main categories of power analysis attack such that simple power analysis, differential power analysis and correlation power analysis. According to different researches, the correlation power analysis attack is the most efficient attack than other types of power analysis attacking methods.
Most of the researches have focused to attack block ciphers using these three types of attacks. But in our project we are focusing to use correlation power analysis (CPA) method to attack stream cipher like 'Trivium'. The 'Trivium' stream cipher is typically new hardware stream cipher implementation which was introduced by 'eSTREAM' project.
